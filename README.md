<h1 align="center">Hi, there! :) </h1>

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- It is a responsive website. You can test different screen sizes on DevTools, for example.

- This project also has a simple figma design. I admit I made the design but I won't prototype it for now.
